Before compiling you'll need to download the latest enet release
from here: http://enet.bespin.org/Downloads.html

Extract the file to somewhere on your computer and copy the 'enet' folder inside the
'include' directory and paste it into this ('dll') location.

Then grab the enet.lib and also paste it in here. It should be now all good,
now go ahead and call compile.

Better use MinGW for compiling on windows.
